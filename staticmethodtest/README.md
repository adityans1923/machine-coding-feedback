# Static method and classes

Static Method (https://www.codingninjas.com/studio/library/static-and-instance-methods-in-java)
1. Method declares static and which are not using any reference to any object, they are thread safe
2. Memory allocation for static and instance method are exactly same except in case of instance method memory is associated with "THIS".
3. Meaning each invocation create a frame on the call stack and only difference is one is accessed via object and other directly by class name.

Static Class
1. Static classes were introduced because we don't want to create unneccesary instance of parent class inorder to be able to create instance of inner child classes.
2. Memory allocation and everything is similar to normal class.
